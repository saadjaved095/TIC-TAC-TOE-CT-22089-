# ðŸ§  Tic-Tac-Toe AI: Minimax vs Alpha-Beta Pruning

This is a command-line implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe in Python where you play against an AI using the Minimax algorithm. It also compares the performance of standard **Minimax** and **Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning** to demonstrate how optimization improves execution time.

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay

- You play as **`X`**, and the AI plays as **`O`**.
- Enter your move using row and column numbers (0 to 2).
- After each of your moves, the AI will compute its optimal move using Alpha-Beta pruning.
- After the game, you'll see a performance comparison between the two algorithms.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### Requirements

No external libraries required. This project uses only standard Python libraries.

### Run the Game

```bash
python tic_tac_toe_ai.py
```

## ðŸ§  AI Logic

### Minimax Algorithm

- Explores all possible game states recursively.
- Returns the best score based on potential wins/losses.
- Computationally expensive as the number of possible states increases.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning

- Optimized version of Minimax.
- Prunes branches that don't influence the final decision.
- Significantly reduces execution time without affecting decision quality.

## ðŸ“Š Performance Comparison

At the end of each game, you'll see a report like:

```
Performance Comparison:
Standard Minimax total time: 0.154832 seconds
Alpha-Beta Pruning total time: 0.045612 seconds
Improvement: 70.54%
```

This shows how Alpha-Beta pruning improves efficiency while making the same strategic decisions.
